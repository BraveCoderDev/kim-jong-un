Hello! I am BraveCoder, diving into web development. Please teach and correct me whenever you find errors. I am a self-learner—but that doesn’t mean I lack teachers. I do have them. Who are they? You could be one, as I learn online. My primary mentors are Dr. Angela Yu ( Udemy courses) and Mr. Ye Myint Soe (HIT Myanmar).
